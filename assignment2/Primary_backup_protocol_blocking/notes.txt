-- A few assumptions:

-> The registry server is hosted at localhost:5555. This address cannot be made available to any normal server.
-> "None" set to a string, should be interpreted as None
-> datetime.min set to a google.protobuf.Timestamp, should be interpreted as None
-> client blocks on read/write/delete ops i.e. they are synchronous calls.
-> folder for servers has prefix SERVER_ 


 

Suppose client 1 sends write request(create new file) to replica 1( not yet forwarded to PR) and client 2 sends delete request (same file) to replica 2.
Will replica 2 send FILE DOES NOT EXIST to client 2 ? Not necessary. All delete/write requests are forwarded to Primary Server first.
