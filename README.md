# DSCD-Winter-2023
This repo contains my code submissions for Distributed Systems Design and Concept 2023 CSE530. Each folder contains a pdf stating the requirements that our code was expected to meet. 

# Key Points
1. In assignment1, I implemented a publish-subscribe system (PubSub)(or a Simplified version of Discord). My PubSub allowed to publish simple articles that can be subsribed to. 3 separate implementations were made: gRPC, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ.

2. In assignment2, I implemented consistency protocols for a distributed key-value store supporting replication: 
a) Primary-backup Blocking protocol (Remote-write) 
b) Primary-backup Non-Blocking protocol (Remote-write) 
c) Quorum-based protocol

3. In the Project, I implemented a map-reduce framework that supports 3 applications/queries: a) Word Count b) Inverted Index c) Natural Join
